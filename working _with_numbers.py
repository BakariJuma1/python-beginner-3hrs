# working with numbers
# integer is a whole number while float is a decimal
# order of operations bodmas works
# comparisons
# equal 3==2
# not equal 3!=2
# num_1 =3
# num_2 =4
# print(num_1==num_2)
# num =3

# check the data type 
# print(type(num))
# print(3%2)

# order of operations
# print(3*(2+1))

# direct multiplying
numOne=2
numOne*=10
print(numOne)

# This round off to i dp
print(round(3.75,1))

# this are strings
num_1='100' 
num_2='200'
# casting use int() as used in this example
num_1 =int(num_1)
num_2=int(num_2)
print(num_1+num_2)
